# The Basics
## Simple SELECTs
1) Query all the data in the `pets` table.
2) Query only the first 5 rows of the `pets` table.
3) Query only the names and ages of the pets in the `pets` table.

6) Query all the male pets in the `pets` table.
7) Query all the cats in the `pets` table.
8) Query all the pets in the `pets` table that are at least 5 years old.
9) Query all the male dogs in the `pets` table. Do not include the sex or species
column, since you already know them.
10) Get all the names of the dogs in the `pets` table that are younger than 5 years
old.
11) Query all the pets in the `pets` table that are either male dogs or female
cats.
12) Query the five oldest pets in the `pets` table.
13) Get the names and ages of all the female cats in the `pets` table sorted by
age, descending.
14) Get all pets from `pets` whose names start with P.

16) Select all employees from `employees_null` where the salary is below $35,000 or
missing.
17) Select all employees from `employees_null` where the job title is missing. What

18) Who is the newest employee in `employees`? The most senior?
19) Select all employees from `employees` named Thomas.
20) Select all employees from `employees` named Thomas or Shannon.
21) Select all employees from `employees` named Robert, Lisa, or any name that
